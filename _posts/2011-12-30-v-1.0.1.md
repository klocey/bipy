There is a new version of `bipy` available as a stable release. This minor revision is mostly focused on improving the usefulness of the `bipartite` class, and some improvements in the execution speed. Notably, the null models and the detection of modules are much more faster (this is clearly usefull when doing a lot of replications).

The two main new features are the addition of a `plot()` method to both the `robustness` and `bipartite` classes, who are described in the [tutorial](){{ site.url }}/tutorial/). Overall, these modifications make syntax of the module easier to understand for the user.

The tutorial and reference pages will be updated in the following days to reflect the changes.
