The new year starts with the release of the version 1.0.2! The most important new feature is the better integration of `bipy` with [`networkx`](http://networkx.lanl.gov/), a very popular and very powerful package for complex network analyses. This integration will be increased in future releases, as some of the functions of `networkx` nicely complement the functions of `bipy`.

It is now possible to save both the network and the analyses that were done up to this point by using the `save` method of the `bipartite` class, so that you can keep your results without having to re-run the full analysis. Loading a restored object is done using `load`.

Finally, the `networklevel` function is now functional, and prints network-wide informations about one of more networks to a text file (or to the screen). In addition to these new features, some internal code was improved and/or ported to C to minimize execution time.
